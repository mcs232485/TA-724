Question-1: Why do you see a difference in webpage fetch times with short and large router buffers?

Answer: The variation in webpage fetch times between short and large router buffers is primarily due to how TCP congestion control and queuing mechanisms interact.

When the router buffer size is large, TCP can continually increase its congestion window, sending more packets into the network without immediate feedback from the congested buffer. This leads to a situation where there's a longer queue of packets waiting to be transmitted. Consequently, each packet experiences a delay before getting through the buffer and being sent to the next hop. This delay accumulates for each packet, resulting in longer fetch times for webpages. In essence, the large buffer delays the transmission of packets, leading to higher latency and extended fetch times.

Conversely, with a smaller router buffer size, the buffer can become congested more quickly. As a result, TCP congestion control mechanisms detect congestion earlier and respond by reducing the congestion window. This limits the number of packets being sent into the network, preventing excessive buildup in the buffer. With fewer packets in the queue, the delay experienced by each packet is shorter, leading to quicker webpage fetch times.


Question-2: Bufferbloat can occur in other places such as your network interface card (NIC). Check the output of ifconfig eth0 on your VirtualBox VM. What is the (maximum) transmit queue length on the network interface reported by ifconfig? For this queue size, if you assume the queue drains at 100Mb/s, what is the maximum time a packet might wait in the queue before it leaves the NIC?

Answer: To assess this, we can examine the output of the 'ifconfig eth0' command on our VirtualBox VM. By doing so, we'll discover the reported maximum transmit queue length on the network interface. Given this queue size, let's assume the queue depletes at a rate of 100 Mb/s. In this scenario, if we consider each packet to be 1500 bytes, the cumulative buffering capacity amounts to 1.5 * 10^6 bytes. With a network speed of 100 Mb/s (equivalent to 1.25 * 10^7 bytes/s), the time a packet might spend waiting in the queue before departing the NIC is approximately 0.12 seconds.


Question-3: How does the RTT reported by ping vary with the queue size? Describe the relation between the two. 

Answer: The RTT increases proportionally with the queue size. Mathematically, we can express this relationship as follows: 
RTT = queue_size * propagation_delay. 
This can be deduced by considering that the RTT encompasses both the time taken for a packet to traverse the propagation path and the additional time it spends in the queue before transmission. Since the propagation delay remains constant, it's evident that a larger queue size leads to an extended RTT.


Question-4: Identify and describe two ways to mitigate the bufferbloat problem.

Answer: 
Strategy 1: Adjust Max Queue Size
One approach to mitigate bufferbloat involves adjusting the maximum queue size within network devices. By reducing the buffer size, especially in scenarios with limited bandwidth, the excessive queuing and subsequent latency increase can be prevented. This ensures that packets are transmitted more promptly, leading to a reduction in Round-Trip Time (RTT) and improved overall network responsiveness.

Strategy 2: Implement Active Queue Management (AQM)
Another effective strategy is the implementation of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms, such as Random Early Detection (RED). AQM algorithms monitor the congestion levels within network buffers and take proactive measures to manage queue lengths. RED, for instance, drops or marks packets with a certain probability as the queue approaches its capacity. This helps prevent bufferbloat by preventing queues from becoming excessively full, thus maintaining a controlled level of latency and reducing the chances of congestion-related issues."


Question-5: Describe how and why your results change when you re-run the emulation. 

Answer: Here are the reasons why and how results might change when the emulation is re-run:

1. Network Conditions: Emulations often mimic real-world network conditions, including bandwidth, latency, and congestion levels. If these conditions are not fixed during each run, variations in network performance, such as available bandwidth or latency fluctuations, can lead to different results.

2. Randomness in Simulations: Many network simulations include elements of randomness to simulate real-world unpredictability. For instance, packet loss, reordering, and queuing can be randomized. As a result, even with the same parameters, the specific sequence of events can differ between runs.

3. Initial State: Some emulations involve initial conditions, such as the state of buffers, queues, or routing tables. These initial conditions might vary between runs, leading to different behaviors and results.

4. Load and Congestion: Emulations often involve sending traffic between nodes. The load or type of traffic can impact the network's behavior. A higher load might lead to congestion and delays, while a lower load might result in smoother traffic flow.

5. Timing and Synchronization: Emulation platforms might not perfectly replicate real-world timing and synchronization. Timing discrepancies can affect when certain events occur, potentially leading to different outcomes.

6. System Resource Utilization: The host system running the emulation might have varying resource utilization between runs. CPU load, memory availability, and other system factors can influence the emulation environment.

7. External Interference: External factors such as background processes, network activity on the host system, or other virtual machines running concurrently can impact the behavior of the emulation.
